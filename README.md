# My first platformer game
A 2D platformer game as my first big project.

## Goal

Get the hero to clear the whole level of monsters.

## Story

Our protagonist is next in line to become king, but his ascension is rudely interrupted by a curse from Lord Pigsturr, his arch-nemesis. The curse has turned everyone in the castle into pigs. Those affected by the curse have become mindless and aggressive, seeing all other races as their enemies. Our 'False King' must reclaim his rightful castle and lift the curse before it's too late.

## Controls

Movement with 'left, right, up and down arrow keys' or 'a, d, w, s keys'.
You attack the enemy with the 'Left Control' button.
Jumping is with the 'Space-bar'.

## Added note

The game is unfinished which means it doesn't have yet a finish. 
Meaning when you defeat all the monsters you can exit the game.
